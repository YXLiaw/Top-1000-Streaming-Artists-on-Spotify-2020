# Top 1000 Most Streamed Artists on Spotify (EDA focus)

**Background**
---
As a music lover and a new user to Spotify, I am keen to have a better understanding on the music market for the most popular artists on Spotify, while also have an in depth analysis on some of my favourite artists' album tracks. For this project, I will be focusing on the dataset for top 1000 most streamed artists on Spotify from the ChartMasters website and using Spotify's web API for data scraping on information related to artists and their album tracks.

By doing so, this will be useful for my informative data analysis on some of the following key topics:
- Factors that makes an artist popular on Spotify
- Audio feature analysis for favourite artists/albums
- Overall year trend of audio features on Spotify
- Artists with very high number of followers/streams on Spotify

**Instructions for Spotify Data Scraping**
---
For extracting data from Spotify, the following fundamental instructions are required to get started:
1. Go to Spotify Developer's website and create a new free account if not yet available: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login
2. Once account is created, select "Create an app" option with a random app name.
3. After creating an app, record down the client ID and client secret, which will be required for authenticating Spotipy object on Jupyter Notebook. (Note that installation of Spotipy onto Python is required prior to data extraction)

**Code and Resources Used**
---
- **Python Version** : 3.7
- **Packages** : pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, ast, math, wordcloud
- **Dataset source** : ChartMasters - https://chartmasters.org/most-streamed-artists-ever-on-spotify/
- **Spotify Web API** : https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/
- **Spotipy documentation** : https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.0/
- **Reference for Spotify Data Extraction Process** : https://medium.com/@RareLoot/extracting-spotify-data-on-your-favourite-artist-via-python-d58bc92a4330

**Data Cleaning**
---
After importing the data extracted from csv to data frames, I needed to clean up the data for further analysis by making the following main changes:
- Convert stream and track count values to integers by removing unwanted characters (comma sign on numbers)
- Create seperate data frame containing individual observations of genre for each artist
- Concatenating multiple data frames of information on album tracks into single data frame
- Compute follower to stream ratio for each top 1000 most streamed aritst
- Encoding data for several columns into categorical data

Currently, pop music dominates the Spotify market from top 1000 most streamed artists on Spotify, followed by dance pop and pop rap as per classified by Spotify.

### Correlation heatmap for artists

A strong correlation (0.89) was observed between stream count and follower count. In addition, there is a slightly higher correlation between stream count and artist popularity (0.69), compared to between follower count and artist popularity (0.61).

Average valence (positiveness) of music tracks have been declining since 1920s. In contrast, there has been a steady increase in emphasis of speechiness (presence of spoken words in a track) and loudness from 1940s.

### Acousticness Distribution between Music Keys on Spotify

While majority of the acousticness distributions are moderately right skewed, distribution of acousticness for "D#, Eb" key is very heavily left skewed and had very low variability in comparison to other music keys.
