**Data Cleaning**
---
After importing the data extracted from csv to data frames, I needed to clean up the data for further analysis by making the following main changes:
- Convert stream and track count values to integers by removing unwanted characters (comma sign on numbers)
- Create seperate data frame containing individual observations of genre for each artist
- Concatenating multiple data frames of information on album tracks into single data frame
- Compute follower to stream ratio for each top 1000 most streamed aritst
- Encoding data for several columns into categorical data

This project is best viewed in a notebook render viewer, which can be accessed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/YXLiaw/Top-1000-Most-Streamed-Artists-on-Spotify-2020/blob/main/Top%201000%20Most%20Streamed%20Artists%20on%20Spotify.ipynb?flush_cache=true). In this notebook, you will find a walkthrough of the work and the respective code with comments on observations from figures/charts.
